TODO
====

*) add graphical shutdown/user-switch, at least to profile.

*) Check for syslinux package if not building grub system. DONE in trunk
  (in usbboot and in buildlive, but in the latter only when building isolinux iso).

*) New init idea. Use custom /etc/inittab which uses /etc/rc.larchinit and
  /etc/rc.larchshutdown instead of /etc/rc.sysinit and /etc/rc.shutdown,
  thus eliminating the need for arch0.tar.gz (hopefully). Only /etc/inittab
  would need replacement on installation (either from the version in system
  or from /etc/inittab.pacnew or as a separate installer file).
   /etc/rc.larchinit and /etc/rc.larchshutdown would be in the larch-live
  package.
   Would I need to add NoUpgrade etc/inittab to my pacman.conf? Shouldn't
  need to. IMPLENTED in 5.2.

*) Do I need to customize the pacman.conf in larch live system? On
  installation too?

*) Are the ignored dirs in /var mentioned in the docs?

*) What about saving a session during normal operation, not only at shutdown?

*) Detect kernel updates and rebuild corresponding parts of boot medium
  (offer to rebuild boot cd?).

*) New package contents in 5.2 documented?

*) larchin. Add LVM support (maybe also RAID?).

*) larchin. Add comments and docstrings.

*) larchin. i18n.

*) Look at liveInstall ...

*) larch gui.
