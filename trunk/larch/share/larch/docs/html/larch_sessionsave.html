<h2>Saving a session back to the boot device (or even somewhere else)</h2>

<p>An easy way to create a customized live-CD or USB-stick is to start from an
existing one, make whatever changes you like, and then save the result back to
the CD or USB-stick.
</p>

<p>In <em>larch</em> the <em>overlay</em> file-system (in the
<em>squashed</em> files 'overlay.sqf', 'etc.sqf' and 'home.sqf') can be rebuilt
from the state of the live system when it shuts down.
This is handled primarily by the script <strong>merge_overlay</strong>, which is
called at shutdown if the file 'save' in the live-medium's root directory contains
"yes" and there is no '/.livesys/nosave' file in the running system. That is, the user will be asked if(s)he wants to save the new overlay.
It merges the contents of the writeable <em>unionfs</em> layer with the old
overlay and creates a new overlay which will be saved back to the boot device,
assuming this is writable. For directly writable devices (e.g. USB-stick) the
default behaviour is to replace the existing files by the new ones, the old
ones being backed up (same name with '~'-suffix). For CD/DVD indexed files are
generated, with names like 'overlay_$$$$.sqf', 'etc_$$$$.sqf' and 'home_$$$$$.sqf',
where the '$' characters are digits. With each save the indexes will be increased by
one. The very first rewritten overlay will get index '0001'.
</p>

<p>At boot time, the latest overlay file is chosen, simply on the basis of an
alphabetical search, so that many modified overlay files can be saved, without
losing the old ones, and always booting with the newest. On a USB-stick it is
probably more desirable to remove old overlay files, so the overwrite method is
now the default in that case.
</p>

<p>It should be possible to include package addition and removal in the list
of customizations undertaken using this method, but on the whole I wouldn't
recommend this. I think it would be better to first rebuild the live-system
with the desired packages, so that they land in 'system.sqf', keeping down the
size and complexity of the overlay file. Especially if the aim is to
develop a custom <em>profile</em>, all packages should definitely be in
'system.sqf'. This session saving facility is mostly intended for developing
customized configurations of already installed packages and for the retention
of user data from one session to another.
</p>

<p>I'm not sure that I would trust important data to a multi-session CD, but
I think this feature should open up some interesting possibilities.
</p>

<h4><a name="de-Act"></a>Activating and deactivating the session-saving feature</h4>

<p>For this feature to be available, certain requirements must be fulfilled. Some
are perhaps too obvious to be mentioned, but I will list them anyway.
</p>

<p>Writing to CD/DVD should only be done when the medium is unmounted.
<em>growisofs</em> is
more rigorous about this than <em>cdrecord</em>, but theoretically it is
a requirement. In <em>larch</em> from version 3 the whole
<em>unionfs</em> / <em>squashfs</em> structure has been organized so that
the boot medium can be unmounted (at shutdown) even without running 'c2r'.
Unfortunately this is quite a tricky business, as it is not always easy
to ensure that there aren't still open files on one of the file-systems
which has to be unmounted.
</p>

<p>As already mentioned, the 'save' file in the boot-medium's root directory
must contain "yes". This is the default when building a <em>larch</em> CD.
To change this, i.e. to make your original overlay permanent,
you need to add a file called 'save' to the 'cd-root' directory
of your build <a href="larch_profiles.html">profile</a>; this file should
contain anything except "yes" ("no" might be appropriate!).
</p>

<p>A new overlay can only be saved if the boot medium is writable -
i.e. USB-stick or writable CD/DVD (that means burnt in multi-session mode!) -
and there must be enough space for the extra data on it.
</p>

<p>It can be a little annoying if one is always asked at shutdown whether
a new overlay should be saved when you only occasionally (maybe only once
or twice) want to do so. So the session-saving feature may also be
turned on and off within the overlay. This is a little tricky,
so pay attention :)!
</p>

<p>At shutdown, the session-save prompt will only occur if there is no
'/.livesys/nosave' file. So you can disable or enable the prompt on a
present-run-only basis by creating or removing this file (it can be an
empty file, only the file's existence is tested).
</p>

<p>When the system boots it copies the file '/larch/nosave' (if it exists) to
'/.livesys/nosave', thus providing a means of remembering your configuration
from one run to the next. Of course, if you want your configuration to be
remembered you must save the overlay (remove '/.livesys/nosave') even if
'/larch/nosave' is present.
</p>

<h4><a name="custom"></a>Customizing the behaviour using scripts</h4>

<p>Most aspects of the session saving can be customized by writing scripts to
override the default behaviour. This is unfortunately not a particularly easy
way to customize the behaviour, as these are shell scripts and their use requires
some knowledge of the inner workings of the larch live system. If you want to
write your own scripts to change the behaviour of the larch live system, it will
almost certainly be necessary to read the existing larch scripts where the
custom scripts are sourced.
</p>
<p>These optional scripts are placed in the
folder <strong>scripts</strong> in the root folder of the boot device, which is
copied to <strong>/.livesys/scripts</strong> during booting.
</p>
<p>Where the sqf files for booting from are found can be customized:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>get_etc</strong>
    <p>In hook larch2 (BEWARE: klibc shell script in initramfs, very limited).
    $etcx must be set to the path to etc*.sqf
    On entry the value is the default one (from the boot device).
    </p>
  </li><strong>get_overlay</strong>
  <li>
    <p>  In rc.sysinit0, in 'base' system, so also quite limited.
    Set $ovlx to the path to the overlay sqf,
    set $ovlh to the path to the home sqf.
    On entry the values are the default ones (from the boot device).
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
    The session-saving at shutdown involves several scripts, each of the shutdown
    scripts uses one. I'll start at the end, with the final shutdown code executed in
    <strong>/etc/rc.shutdown3</strong> (note that only the rather limited
    'base' environment is available from that script).
<ul>
  <li><strong>shutdown-save</strong>
    <p>This is sourced by <strong>/etc/rc.shutdown3</strong> in order to
    alter the default saving behaviour. The default behaviour depends on
    $savedev and $ejectdev:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Save device is CD/DVD, which must be ejected ($savedev = $ejectdev)
            e.g. savedev='/dev/sr0', ejectdev='/dev/sr0'
      </li>
      <li>CD/DVD needs ejecting, save device is USB-stick, etc.
            e.g. savedev='/dev/sdb1', ejectdev='/dev/sr0'
      </li>
      <li>Nothing needs ejecting, save device is USB-stick, etc.
            e.g. savedev='/dev/sdb1', ejectdev='-'
      </li>
      <li>Nothing needs saving, CD/DVD needs ejecting
            e.g. savedev='-', ejectdev='/dev/sr0'
      </li>
      <li>Nothing needs saving, nothing needs ejecting
            savedev='-', ejectdev='-'
      </li>
    </ol><br />
    <p>Saving to CD/DVD means writing the files in
    <strong>/.livesys/new-sqf</strong> to a new session.
    </p>
    <p>Saving to other devices means mounting the device and renaming any
    files ending '.sqf_' to the same without the '_'.
    </p>
    <p>The script can use $savedev and $ejectdev, which are passed via
    <strong>rc.shutdown2</strong> from <strong>rc.shutdown</strong>. It can
    do the saving itself, in which
    case it should set $savedev to '-', to inhibit the default saving, or
    it can use the default saving. It can use $savepath (default '') to
    use a subdirectory (which must exist) within the save device
    (not CD/DVD), e.g.
    savepath='/mysaves'
    </p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>shutdown-unmount</strong>
    <p>This is sourced by <strong>/etc/rc.shutdown3</strong><strong></strong>. It should
    unmount any remaining mounts which are not accounted for elsewhere
    (i.e. which arise through customizations). This should only be necessary
    in the case where system.sqf/base.sqf, overlay.sqf/etc.sqf and home.sqf are
    on 3 separate devices, as /.livesys/livecd and /.livesys/savedev are
    already catered for.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>session-save</strong>
    <p>This is sourced by <strong>rc.shutdown</strong> after it has set
    $bdev to the boot CD/DVD device (if there is one which is still
    mounted at <strong>/.livesys/livecd</strong>), otherwise '-'. Also
    $savedev='-'.
    </p>
    <p>The default behaviour (i.e. without this script) is to set $savedev
    to the boot device (the device mounted at <strong>/.livesys/livecd</strong>)
    if this feature is enabled via the <strong>/.livesys/livecd/save</strong>
    and <strong>/.livesys/nosave</strong> files followed by user confirmation
    (the old behaviour).
    </p>
    <p>This script can use $savedev and/or alternative means, in conjunction
    with the later scripts (<strong>shutdown-unmount</strong> and
    <strong>shutdown-save</strong>) to specify
    how the saving should be done. If it sets $savedev != '-' then the user
    will be asked if the overlay should be saved, and merge_overlay will
    be called with $savepath (default <strong>/.livesys/livecd</strong>) as
    argument. If some other behaviour is wanted, this must then be contained
    in the script, including asking the user and calling
    <strong>merge_overlay</strong>, which requires.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>merge-adjust</strong>
    <p>This script is sourced by <strong>merge_overlay</strong>, whose
    default behaviour is to perform the overlay merging operation in memory
    (in the system tmpfs, merge_base=<strong>/.livesys</strong>), but by
    setting $merge_base to some other writable directory, say on a disk
    drive, the merging can be done there.
    The sqf files are then built (by default) in the $overlaypath directory,
    with the original name + '_' (as suffix), unless this is not writable
    (presumably a CD/DVD), in which case indexed files are built to
    <strong>/.livesys/new-sqf</strong>. Possible customizations might be:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Only rebuild home sqf (no merging is necessary)
      </li>
      <li>Use different devices for overlay/etc and home sqfs
      </li>
      <li>Use indexed sqfs also on non CD/DVD devices
      </li>
    </ul><br />
    <p>The variables which can be altered are defined and described at the
    beginning of <strong>merge_overlay</strong>.
    </p>
  </li>
