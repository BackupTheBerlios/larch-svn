Version 5.3.0, new initscripts approach, replacing functions in /etc/rc.d/functions
rather than replacing /etc/rc.sysinit and /etc/rc.shutdown. At present this
requires a custom initscripts package.

2008.04.21
Version 5.2.2, added usb2iso, a fairly primitive script to make an iso from
a larch usb-stick. It also works from a running larch system, but only on
systems with a lot of memory.

2008.04.05
version 5.2.1, slight reworking of overlay handling in profiles - now files
owned by root:root do not have to be in overlay.xpk, they can be held within
directory 'rootoverlay', and their ownership will be changed automatically.
Files to be copied to /.livesys at boot are now in larch/copy.
Added larchquit.py to larch-live - special larch quit/logout gui, allows
selecting session-save options and also autologin user before quitting desktop,
included it in xmini menu/panel.
Other tweaks to xmini profile.

2008.02.27
Incompatible changes. WARNING!
With version 5.2 the init system has changed, in particular a custom inittab
is now required, which means all old profiles are likely to fail (because of
the /etc/inittab in the overlay).
