<h1><big>larch</big>

<h2>Profiles</h2>

<p>This feature of the <em>larch</em> scripts allows bundling
all the configuration information for a particular live CD 'design' into
a single directory. That includes the list of packages to be installed, locale
information and the particular tweaks and additions needed to customize the CD,
in particular a subdirectory containing the 'overlay' files - those files
which have been changed from their initial fresh state after installation
and those which have simply been added.
</p>

<p>In order to allow more flexibility with the overlay, <em>larch</em> requires that
everything in this overlay directory has the correct permissions and ownerships.
That means you have to be quite careful when editing this area manually.
It is however intended that most of the tweaking will be done <em>in situ</em>
(i.e. within a running live USB system), using a utility - see
<a href="larch_sessionsave.html">'Session saving'</a> - to recreate
the compressed overlay file-system (<strong>overlay.ovl</strong>).
</p>

<p>To make it a little more difficult to make a mess while editing the initial
overlays, e.g. by unpacking a profile (well, the overlay part) as a normal user,
I have included a little self-extracting archive utility, <em>xpack</em>, which enables
archives to be so packed that only root can unpack them. The overlays in the
supplied example profiles are packed with this utility to <strong>overlay.xpk</strong>
archives.
</p>

<p>If you would like to have a look at a profile, look in the 'profiles'
directory in the distribution. Each of its subdirectories is a profile, the
subdirectory name is also the profile name. If you want to make your own
profile, it is probably easiest to start with one of the examples. Copy it to a
working directory and rename it appropriately.
If you want to unpack the overlay archive, you need to be root, go to the directory
and run
<pre>
        ./overlay.xpk .
</pre>
(don't miss the final '.', the unpacker needs an existing
directory as parameter).
</p>

<p>After editing to your heart's content, you can build the corresponding live
CD system with the call:
<pre>
        (path/to/)mklarch -p directory
</pre>
where 'directory' is your profile directory. You don't need to bother about
repacking your 'overlay' directory, as an unpacked 'overlay' directory has
precedence over an 'overlay.xpk' archive. But if you do want to repack it,
delete the old 'overlay.xpk' and run (as root)
<pre>
        (path/to/)xpack -r overlay overlay.xpk
</pre>
xpack is found in the <em>larch</em> 'run' directory.
</p>

<p>The important files within a profile are described below:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>addedpacks</strong> - a simple list of packages (just package
  name as supplied to 'pacman -S', e.g. 'syslinux', not the file name), one per line,
  comment lines start with '#'.
  This is the primary place for configuring which packages are installed.
  </li>

  <li><strong>locale.gen</strong> - <em>mklarch</em> prefixes this profile
  file (if it is present) to the file '/etc/locale.gen' in the newly installed
  system and runs 'locale-gen' (using <em>chroot</em>) to deal with glibc
  locale generation.
  So just put the locales you want in here.
  </li>

  <li><strong>rcconfx</strong> - This is a list of modifications for '/etc/rc.conf'.
  It contains those variable definitions which are different to the default
  values. This is then merged with the original to produce a modified overlay file.
  </li>

  <li><strong>overlay.xpk</strong> - As described above this is a self-extracting
  archive of 'overlay files', which will form the bulk of the overlay squashfs.
  </li>

  <li><strong>mkinitcpio.conf</strong> - This file is optional. If it is present it will
  replace the version in the 'initcpio_files/lib/initcpio' folder of the
  <em>larch</em> package to produce the initramfs
  for the live CD. You should take that file as the starting point to ensure that
  the necessary larch hooks are installed, but you are free to change other hooks
  (e.g. use 'ide' instead of 'pata') or add modules.
  </li>

  <li><strong>basepacks</strong> - This file is optional. If it is present it
  supplies a list of packages (one package per line, as <em>addedpacks</em>) to be
  used instead of the standard list of 'core/base' packages for the basis of the
  installation done by <em>mklarch</em>, preventing the 'packages.txt' file from the
  'core' repository from being downloaded and used as source for the base package list.
  </li>

  <li><strong>baseveto</strong> - This file is optional. It provides a list of
  packages (one package per line) to be ignored in the base package list.</li>

  <li><strong>cd-root</strong> - This directory contains files to configure the bootloader.
  Those for <em>isolinux</em> are in the directory 'isolinux', which is copied to the
  root CD directory when the <em>isolinux</em> bootloader is chosen. Those for
  <em>GRUB</em> are in the directory 'boot', which is copied to the
  root CD directory when the <em>GRUB</em> bootloader is chosen. Here you can
  configure things like boot menus and splash screens.
  Anything in the 'cd-root' folder will be copied directly to the root of the live medium, so
  if there is anything else you want on your medium, you can put it in here.
  </li>
</ul>
