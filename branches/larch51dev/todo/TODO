*) New init idea. Use custom /etc/inittab which uses /etc/rc.larchinit and
  /etc/rc.larchshutdown instead of /etc/rc.sysinit and /etc/rc.shutdown,
  thus eliminating the need for arch0.tar.gz (hopefully). Only /etc/inittab
  would need replacement on installation (either from the version in system
  or from /etc/inittab.pacnew or as a separate installer file).
   /etc/rc.larchinit and /etc/rc.larchshutdown would be in the larch-live
  package.
   Would I need to add NoUpgrade etc/inittab to my pacman.conf? Shouldn't
  need to. IMPLENTED in 5.2.

*) Do I need to customize the pacman.conf in larch live system? On
  installation too?

*) Are the ignored dirs in /var mentioned in the docs?

*) What about saving a session during normal operation, not only at shutdown?

*) Detect kernel updates and rebuild corresponding parts of boot medium
  (offer to rebuild boot cd?).

*) When creating new overlays name them first (say) mods.tmp and overlay.tmp
  so that if an error occurs (a crash, power off, ...) the next boot attempt
  will not be disturbed by unfinished or corrupted overlays.
   The boot process should also delete any such files it finds. HAVE I DONE THIS?
   When both files have been successfully created, they can be renamed.

*) New package contents in 5.2 documented?

*) larchin. Add LVM support (maybe also RAID?).

*) larchin. Add comments and docstrings.

*) larchin. i18n.

*) Look at liveInstall ...

*) larch gui.
