This branch is for a simplified live-medium structure using a union-root.

Session saving on CD/DVD is dropped, but will be retained on USB-stick, in
a slightly modified form.


I am testing a hardwired copy2ram for the overlay (of which there is now
only be one). The underlying system is in system.sqf, but the home directory
can, optionally, be squashed separately.

Session saving is - I hope - simply a matter of compressing the overlay layer
of the union. That should speed up session saving a bit.

To further increase speed I am trying tar and lzop instead of squashfs for
this overlay.

If the overlay gets big, there should be support for merging it back into
the underlying squashed system. That could be done as via a special boot
option, which would perform the merge and then reboot (if necessary).

This restriction of squashfs to the base system would also clear the way to
supporting lzma, because the speed should be less important if the
overlays don't need to be compressed with it, and recreation of the
squashed files will be relatively rare.

tar / lzo:
==========

Compress:
tar -cf - src | lzop > src.tar.lzo

Uncompress:
lzop -d < src.tar.lzo | tar -xf -

Could use lzf (liblzf) instead of lzo, but lzo may be slightly better?
lzf is much smaller, and easy to compile - can also use klcc.
Both seem a lot faster at compressing than squashfs or gzip (more than
twice as fast?), decompression is similar in all cases, but gzip may be
very slightly slower. squashfs looks better than gzip - smaller file,
slightly faster - but it may just be the settings. lzf/lzo lose a few
percent of compression (squashfs ~10% smaller?).
