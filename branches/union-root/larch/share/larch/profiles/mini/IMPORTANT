Note that the overlay files must have the correct ownerships!

If the directory 'overlay' is not present in this directory, you will
need to unpack it by running from within this directory (as root):

./overlay.xpk .

That will unpack the preset overlay. Of course you can always create
your own overlay directory from scratch, but (I repeat myself) please
be careful with the ownerships. The 'buildlive' script for making a
live CD copies the contents of the overlay directory with  'cp -a',
preserving the ownerships that are set here, so they must be correct.

It does not bother the 'buildlive' script if there is no overlay
directory - if that is not present it will use 'overlay.xpk'.
