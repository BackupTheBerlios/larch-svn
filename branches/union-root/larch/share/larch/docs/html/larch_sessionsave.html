<h2>Saving a session back to the boot device (or even somewhere else)</h2>

<p>An easy way to create a customized live-USB-stick is to start from an
existing one, make whatever changes you like, and then save the result back to
the USB-stick.
</p>

<p>In <em>larch</em> the <em>overlay</em> file-system (in the
<em>compressed</em> file 'overlay.ovl' can be rebuilt
from the state of the live system when it shuts down.
This is handled primarily by the customized shutdown script <strong>/etc/rc.shutdown</strong>.
If the medium is writable and contains a file 'larch/save', the user is offered the possibility of
rewriting the overlay archive, this saving the current state.
</p>

<h3>Updating packages</h3>

<p>It should be possible to include package addition and removal in the list
of customizations undertaken using this method, but there are some limitations. Apart from
size considerations (the overlay is unpacked into memory at boot), there is also
a limitation connected with the kernel. Essentially, the kernel and its modules may not
be updated. <strong>If you do this, you may well make a mess of your system</strong>.
In other words, be very careful with 'pacman -S' - only upgrade selected packages.
</p>
<p>The reason for this is that the kernel is not contained within the
squashed file-system, but is held separately on the boot medium, while its modules
are contained in the squashed system and also in the initramfs. Updating these is not
impossible (if booting from a writable medium), but <em>pacman</em> cannot do it and
it is not straightforward (e.g. using a CD to boot to a USB-stick on a computer not
supporting USB boot would additionally need a new CD). A complete rebuild of the live
system might be a better approach.
</p>

<h3><a name="de-Act"></a>Activating and deactivating the session-saving feature</h3>

<p>As mentioned above, for this feature to be available, there must be a file with
the name 'save' in the boot medium's 'larch' directory.
</p>

<h3><a name="merge"></a>Merging the overlay back into the squashed system archives(d)</h3>

<p>The overlay archive is unpacked into memory at boot and repacked when saving
the session at shutdown. When this archive grows too large it will reduce the
amount of available memory, perhaps to an unacceptable extent. It will also
lengthen boot and shutdown times. To counter this, it is possible to merge the
overlay archive into the system archives (which are normally not copied to
memory). This somewhat lengthy process is available as a boot option, and it can
be run when the overlay has become too big for comfort.
</p>

<p>If you have built separate system and home (<em>squashfs</em>) archives, you can
choose to merge the whole overlay (boot option 'merge=all'), or just the /home
folder (boot option 'merge=home'). Otherwise only 'merge=all' is available.
The merging will run without user intervention and upon completion the system will
reboot.
</p>

<h3><a name="custom"></a>Customizing the behaviour using scripts</h3>

<p>Some aspects of the session saving can be customized by writing scripts to
override the default behaviour. These scripts are kept on the boot medium, in the
'larch' directory. As these are shell scripts and their use requires
some knowledge of the inner workings of the larch live system, it will
almost certainly be necessary to read the existing larch scripts where the
custom scripts are 'sourced' if you want to
write your own scripts to change the behaviour of the larch live system.
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>session-save</strong>
    <p>In <strong>/etc/rc.shutdown</strong>. This script can be used to customize the creation of
    the new overlay archive, e.g. by specifying a new location. The default
    is 'overlay.ovl' on the boot medium.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>boot-init</strong>
    <p>In initramfs hook <strong>larch3</strong>. This script allows the choice of different
    system and overlay archives (defaults are system.sqf, overlay.ovl and, optionally,
    home.sqf on the boot medium) during the boot process.
    Note that the shell environment here is that of the initramfs and thus
    very limited.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>boot-merge</strong>
    <p>In initramfs hook <strong>larch3</strong>. This script allows modification of the archive
    merging function (boot option 'merge=all/home').
    Note that the shell environment here is that of the initramfs and thus
    very limited.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
