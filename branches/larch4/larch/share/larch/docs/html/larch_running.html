<h2>Running a <em>larch</em> live-CD/USB system</h2>

<p>Of course the details depend on what you have installed and how you have
configured it. For example, the 'mini' profile builds a console-only system,
the 'default' profile boots to KDE.
</p>

<p>One thing worth noting is that these supplied profiles automatically login
to the root account,
which - potentially - allows all sorts of 'dangerous' actions, like reformatting
your disks or making a mess of your file-systems in other ways. This is because
one of the main <em>raisons d'Ãªtre</em> for <em>larch</em> is its use as an
Arch-installation-and-rescue medium. For this, you need root access.
However, if you want to use the system in other ways, e.g. for text or image editing,
or for internet browsing or e-mail writing, it might be safer to do this as an
unprivileged user. Such a user is easily created with the 'adduser' command, or
in KDE with 'kuser'. If you have a writeable boot medium, such changes can be
'remembered' by saving the session when you shut the system down (the possibility
will normally be offered automatically).
</p>

<h4><a name="bootparm"></a>Boot parameters</h4>

<p>As the <em>larch</em> build system is highly configurable, the available
boot parameters can also vary, but by default 'swap' and 'c2r' are provided.
'swap' indicates that an existing swap partition should be used (the default
is not to use it). 'c2r' means 'copy to RAM', i.e. the system data is copied
to main memory before the system is initialized. This allow the system to run
very fast and frees up the boot device (e.g. the boot CD can be ejected and the
drive used for another CD), but it does require a lot of memory (significantly
more than the size of the boot medium), and the boot process is rather slow
because so much data must be copied. Because of the high memory usage, I have
arranged it so that 'c2r' also implies 'swap'.
</p>

<h4><a name="config"></a>Configuration</h4>

<p>The supplied profiles are just intended as starting points for your own
configurations, they are fairly primitive, in fact only a little more than a newly
installed Arch sytem. If you are running a profile with X11, you may find that you
need to configure it before it will run. A basic <strong>/etc/X11/xorg.conf</strong>
is supplied, which should work in many cases, but if not you will need to go
through the normal configuration procedure. At present no attempt is made at
automatic configuration.
</p>

<p>If you are stuck with the console, there is still hope. It's not as pretty or
newbie friendly as an X11 desktop, but still quite capable. I always like to have
<em>mc</em> available, it's a real godsend for non-geeks (you should also install
<em>lynx</em> so that HTML files can be displayed on the console - at a
pinch you can also surf with it, but it is painful). Because of the high
probability of my using <em>mc</em> in a console I have not set my default
locale to UTF-8 - at present <em>mc</em> can't cope with it (but in the
community repo there is mc-utf8, which seems to work pretty well).
</p>

<p> If your console keyboard map is
wrong, try running <i>km</i> (I stole this from the
standard Arch install CD and modified it a bit to work in <em>larch</em>).
But bear in mind that this only changes the keyboard map for the current run.
If you want to 'session-save' the keyboard change, the keyboard map must also be
set in '/etc/rc.conf'.
</p>

<p>To get X working, you can try <em>xorgconfig</em>, or maybe <em>hwd</em>.
As a last resort, or for final tweaking, you can edit <strong>/etc/X11/xorg.conf</strong>
by hand. Start X with <em>startx</em>.
</p>

<p>If you have a DHCP server on your network, you might well find that
the network interface is configured automatically (assuming your <em>rc.conf</em>
is configured appropriately). On my prototype, I could just fire up <em>konqueror</em>
and the world was my oyster, as they say. If not, well I'm afraid it's
not so easy. Until someone comes up with something better, you'll have
to edit the appropriate configuration files (primarily '/etc/rc.conf')
- see the Archlinux documentation for details - and then do
'/etc/rc.d/network start'. If you already have a running network
interface but want to change it, you may need to stop it running first,
using 'stop' instead of 'start', then make the changes, then start it.
I don't know if 'restart' would work (it stops then starts the network)
after a change to the configuration.
</p>

<p>Of course the exact details of what you can do depends on what
software you installed, so I won't rabbit on endlessly about it here.
Nearly all configuration details should be just the same as in a normal,
hard-disk based installation.
</p>

<h4><a name="eject"></a>Ejecting the live CD (only with copy-to-ram)</h4>

<p>The script <strong>eject_boot_dev</strong> may be used to unmount and eject
the boot CD, if the boot parameter 'c2r' was used, i.e. if the system has
been copied to memory, thus freeing up the drive for other disks.
</p>

<h4><a name="larch_repo"></a>Using a custom package repository on the boot medium</h4>

<p>The build scripts allow the inclusion of a custom package repository on the
boot medium, in the directory 'packages'. This repository is given the name 'live'.
By default this is not activated in
'/etc/pacman.conf', but a little script, <strong>live_repo_on</strong>,
is provided to activate it. It is placed at the head of the repository list,
so it will have the highest priority. Note that 'pacman -Sy' must then
be run before the repository can be used. It will of course only work while the
medium is mounted, so if using 'copy-to-ram', don't remove the medium.
</p>

<h4><a name="install"></a>Installation to hard disk</h4>

<p>The Arch installer <em>archin</em> may be used to install Archlinux to hard disk.
It is actually a separate project because it is not
tied to <em>larch</em> and should thus get its own documentation (unfortunately
this hasn't happened yet, but it's usage should be very straightforward - just
run 'archin').
</p>

<p>In addition to the 'normal' installation using ftp, it is possible
to install the contents of the <em>larch</em>-CD to hard disk. This is
basically a copying of the running system but a few live-CD specific
bits are removed.
