<h2>Overview of the <em>larch</em> build system</h2>

<blockquote>
<h3>Warning</h3>

<p><em>Before we get started I should point out that most of the scripts need to
be run by the 'root' user. That is quite normal for an installer, but it is somewhat
risky - a slight slip and all sorts of damage could be done. Ideally you would
have a machine specially set aside for this sort of thing, i.e. one without any
important data on it. <strong>You have been warned!</strong></em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<h4><a name="larch_installation"></a>Installation of the <em>larch</em> build system</h4>

<h5>Method 1</h5>
<p><em>larch</em> may be installed in the normal Archlinux way using <em>pacman</em>. It
has a single dependency, 'pacin'. The '[larch]' repository should be placed
<strong><em>before all the others</em></strong> in '/etc/pacman.conf', in case it contains
replacement packages for some of the standard ones. The URL for the <em>larch</em>
repository can be got from the download page. This method will only work on an Arch
system, of course. And, because building the live CD requires packages from the
<em>larch</em> repository, this <strong><em>must</em></strong> be present in
'/etc/pacman.conf'. To install <em>larch</em>, run 'pacman -Sy larch'.
</p>

<h5>Method 2</h5>
<p>Alternatively, <em>larch</em> may be used without installing it. This should also
work on non-Arch Linux systems. Create an empty
directory somewhere convenient and place the <strong>larch-setup.sh</strong> script
in it. 'cd' to the directory and run the script. A sub-directory 'larch' will be
created containing the <em>larch</em> scripts, and also a new script,
<strong>mklarch</strong>, which should be used instead of the one supplied with the
'larch' package. If you don't put this new directory on your 'PATH', you may well
need to add a path prefix when running it (e.g. './mklarch' if your current
directory is the one containing the script).
</p>

<h4><a name="larch_using"></a>Using the <em>larch</em> build system</h4>

<p>The main script from the user's point of view is <strong>mklarch</strong>,
which calls other scripts to do most of the work. In the simplest case of building
a <em>larch</em> iso from a predefined 'profile', a single call to <strong>mklarch</strong>
will suffice, e.g.:
<pre>
        mklarch -p default
</pre>
</p>

<p>The <em>larch</em> live CD/USB system is based on a pristine, fresh Archlinux
installation, lovingly packaged in a <em>squashfs</em> file-system.
The fresh Archlinux installation is prepared by using the installation script <strong>pacin</strong> (in the 'pacin' package), which is called
automatically by <em>mklarch</em> with the correct options. Unlike a normal
installation, a separate partition is not required, it can be placed anywhere
convenient. The default installation directory (INSTLDIR) should normally be acceptable
('/home/larchroot', with the building work being done in the '.larch' sub-directory).
INSTLDIR can be changed in <strong>config_larch</strong> (in the full installation in
'/usr/share/larch', in the method 2 installation in 'larch/share/larch').
Note that lots of space is necessary in INSTLDIR, nearly 4GB for a 700MB CD.
</p>

<h4><a name="config_larch"></a><strong>config_larch</strong></h4>

<p>This is a configuration file for <em>mklarch</em>, which
allows you to set where the <em>larch</em> stuff will be built (INSTLDIR)
and the location of an optional package directory to copy to the CD (PACKAGES)
(the latter could also contain things other than packages, it is not used by the
live system). You can also add further configuration options for <em>pacin</em>,
such as an alternative package cache or base-package-set veto list. The
default 'config_larch' is in '[path-to]/share/larch', but it can be overridden
by placing a modified version in the working directory, i.e. the current directory
when <em>mklarch</em> is called.</p>

<h4><a name="running_mklarch"></a>Quick <em>mklarch</em> overview</h4>

<p>That first stage is very much like a normal Arch installation to a
partition - which is another possibility with the <strong>pacin</strong> script.
A couple of small tweaks are made to this base installation to make it more
convenient for live CD/USB use. Some glibc locales are generated (set by the file
locale.gen in the selected profile) and, if <em>openssh</em> is installed, the initial
ssh-keys are generated. Also a few unnecessary files are removed (pacman
database files and invalid initrd images).
</p>

<p>The result of this first part of <em>mklarch</em> is a freshly
installed Archlinux system at '${INSTLDIR}'. If you pass the '-a'
option to <strong>mklarch</strong> it will stop there, without doing the rest of
the build. If you set up your configuration
wrong (or if you or I made some other mistake ...), you might find
you have destroyed some important data and/or your system doesn't
work any more. But that's life - Share and Enjoy!
</p>

<p>The rest of the build process is handled by the functions in
<strong>buildlive</strong>, primarily <em>mklive</em>,
which puts all the various components together into a CD image at
'${INSTLDIR}/.larch/cd', then using the <em>build_iso</em> function
to create the iso or (using the <strong>usbboot</strong> script) to prepare
a bootable USB-stick.
</p>

<h4><a name="Minimal_build_system_requirements"></a>Minimal build system requirements</h4>

<p>The <em>larch</em> scripts have been designed to work without heavy
demands on the build system. Although they have been developed under Archlinux,
they should run on other GNU/Linux systems. The required software has been
kept to a minimum by means of a sort of bootstrapping - some of the build
functions are carried out on the newly installed Arch system using <em>chroot</em>.
For example, you do not need support for <em>squashfs</em> or <em>unionfs</em> on
the build system. If <em>pacman</em> is not found, it will be downloaded. However, <em>bash</em>, <em>mkisofs</em>, <em>wget</em> and <em>python</em>
are assumed to be available.
</p>

<h4><a name="Squashfs_and_Unionfs"></a>Squashfs and Unionfs</h4>

<p>The newly installed system is made into a <em>squashed</em> file-system in the
file <strong>system.sqf</strong>. However, a small but essential part is
extracted and packaged separately in <strong>base.sqf</strong>. This is
copied to memory at boot (regardless of the 'c2r' boot parameter), and deals
with mounting the rest of the system using <em>unionfs</em>. It also
contains the binaries for writing to CD/DVD, for session saving at
shutdown - as these don't work with a mounted device. The modifications
to the basic system to customize it for use as a live CD/USB are done
separately from this in additional <em>squashed</em> file-systems,
<strong>overlay.sqf</strong> and <strong>etc.sqf</strong> (the latter also
being copied to memory as it contains essential boot files).
The overlay files are placed 'on top of' those in the underlying system by
building <em>unionfs</em> hierarchies, each with a writable layer on top
so that the whole file-system appears writable, although the files may be on
a read only medium. Of course only the <em>tmpfs</em> top layer can actually
be written to,
and its contents disappear when the system reboots, so the writing is only
temporary.
</p>
<p>The entire 'home' directory is kept in its own <em>squashed</em> file-system
in the file <strong>home.sqf</strong>.
</p>

<p>In order to boot into a system constructed in that way, you need an
<em>initramfs</em> which deals with mounting all the various bits in the right
way before entering the normal boot sequence. In <em>larch</em> version 4 the
<em>initramfs</em> is built using the standard Arch 'mkinitcpio' system, for
which special 'hooks' (essentially code plug-ins) have been developed.
</p>

<h4><a name="aufs"></a>aufs as an alternative to unionfs</h4>
<p>It is possible to use <em>aufs</em> instead of <em>unionfs</em>. In order
to do that you need package 'aufs' in <strong>addedpacks</strong>, the rest
will then be handled automatically.
</p>

<h4><a name="Partial_rebuilding"></a>Partial rebuilding</h4>

<p>If you make some changes to a build which don't
affect the base system (the Archlinux installation in '${INSTLDIR}'),
you can call <strong>mklarch</strong> with the '-b' option. Such changes might
be tweaks to the overlay, or 'rcconfx', for example (but note that the glibc
locales are in the installation so if you want to change these, you have to rerun the
whole installation). If - as is likely - the 'system.sqf' and 'base.sqf' files
from the previous build are still there, these will be reused, saving the time
taken to <em>squash</em> them up. If you want to force rebuilding of these
sqf files, pass the '-r' option to <strong>mklarch</strong>.
</p>
<p> If you only make changes to files in '${INSTLDIR}/.larch/cd', you can rebuild
the iso using the '-i' option to <strong>mklarch</strong>. But be aware that
some of the files in the directories
'isolinux' (when using the <em>isolinux</em> bootloader) and 'boot' (when using the <em>GRUB</em> bootloader) are renewed from 'larch/cd-root' and the 'cd-root'
directory in the <em>profile</em>.
</p>
<p><em><strong>N.B.</strong> Even though the Arch installation is
in principle now redundant, you shouldn't delete it if you want to do a quick
rebuild using the '-b' option, because this installation is used (via 'chroot')
for some of the build functions.</em>
</p>

<h4><a name="Custom_packages"></a>Custom packages</h4>

<p>It is possible to include your own 'custom' packages in the installation.
Maybe ones you have compiled yourself, e.g. from the AUR, or modified versions
(fixes or customisations) of standard packages. All you have to do is put your
packages in a directory and pass the path to this directory to <strong>pacin</strong>
by setting PACINOPTS appropriately in <strong>config_larch</strong>, e.g.

<pre style="margin-left: 80px;">
PACINOPTS="-p /home/archuser/mypackages"</pre>

<strong>pacin</strong> generates
the repository database file automatically, using the <strong>gen_repo</strong>
script. A copy of 'pacman.conf' is modified so that this repository is placed
ahead of the standard ones, thus these packages take precedence over those in
'core' and 'extra'. Any packages you want installed now just need to be
listed in <strong>addedpacks</strong>.
</p>

<p>The standard kernel ('kernel26') can be used. It includes <em>unionfs</em>
and <em>squashfs</em> modules, and is now included in the set of 'base'
packages. If <em>aufs</em> is desired (which is likely, as at the time of writing
<em>unionfs</em> didn't work very well), this must be included in <strong>addedpacks</strong>, together with 'initcpio_larch_aufs' instead of
'initcpio_larch', which is needed for <em>unionfs</em>.
</p>

<h4><a name="Generating_the_basepacks_list"></a>Generating
the <em>basepacks</em> list</h4>

<p>In case the base package set changes, I have
automated the generation of this list. <em>wget</em> is used to download the
<strong>packages.txt</strong> file from the 'core' repository. The first
server containing '/core' in its path in the selected
<strong>pacman.conf</strong> file is used. If the server is set to a local
directory, 'cp' is used to get the file. This file
is then filtered using a simple <em>grep/sed</em>
command to get the desired list.
</p>
<p><strong>pacman.conf</strong> itself is first sought in the directory from which
<em>mklarch/pacin</em> was run. If it is not found there, the version in '/etc' is
taken, and if that doesn't exist (e.g. because the host system is not Arch),
the version in '...path-to/share/pacin' is taken.
</p>

<p>To get a full listing of possible options to <em>pacin</em> run it without arguments.
</p>

<p>It is possible to filter out certain unwanted packages from the base set.
In most cases the default setting will be satisfactory, but you can change it by
passing a file containing vetoed packages to pacin, with the '-x' option. This
is done automatically if there is a 'baseveto' file in the profile
directory. Be aware, however, that vetoed packages will be installed anyway
if they are depended on by some other installed package.
The format for the 'baseveto' file is very simple. Each package to be vetoed
must be at the beginning of a line of its own and be terminated by a '/',
e.g.:
</p>
<pre>xfsprogs/
xfsdump/
</pre>

<h4><a name="addedpacks"></a><em>addedpacks</em></h4>

<p>This group of packages is the main place for defining your system.
Here you can enter all the
applications you would like in your live CD/USB system (and subsequently
installed to a hard disk partition, if that was your intention).
Thanks to <i>pacman</i> you don't need to sort out
dependencies,
these should all be included automatically. It is (still) possible to
squeeze (or rather 'squash') quite a respectable quantity of software
onto a CD - my first experiments included most of <i>KDE</i>,
<i>OpenOffice</i>, <i>K3b</i>, <i>GIMP</i>, and quite a lot
besides.</p>

<h4><a name="Installation"></a>Installation
of the 'pristine' system</h4>

<p>If there is no '/etc/pacman.conf' file on your build system (probably because it
is not an Arch system), a default one is supplied in the 'pacin' package. You can also
supply one (overriding the other possibilities) in the working directory (the directory
from which <em>mklarch</em> - or <em>pacin</em> - was called).
If there is no 'pacman', it will be downloaded
and the statically linked version used.
</p>

<p>The foundation of the <em>larch</em> live CD/USB system is, in a way, a pretty clean,
unconfigured Archlinux system, <em>squashed</em> up in the file 'system.sqf'
(and 'base.sqf').
The initial installation of this system is handled by <em>pacman</em>, which
installs all the constituent packages using
the '-r' option to install to the chosen location, which can be anywhere where
there is enough space.</p>

<p>Note that the
present design of the scripts will cause downloaded packages to be
cached. The location of the cache is configurable, by passing an option to
<em>pacin</em>), but the default location
('/var/cache/pacman/pkg') is recommended, as it allows the existing
standard Arch package cache to be utilized (assuming you are using
Arch!).</p>

<h4><a name="existingSystem"></a>Making a live CD from an existing Arch
installation</h4>

<p>New in <em>larch</em> version 4 is the ability to make a live CD (or
USB-stick) from an existing Arch installation. The '-x' option to
<em>mklarch</em>, taking the mount point of the installation as argument,
achieves this. The installation must already be mounted, including any
sub-mounts (e.g. /home on another partition). The main mount must be with
options 'exec,dev', because some of the building is done via a <em>chroot</em>
to the installation.
</p>
<p>There is also the '-X' option, which allows the creation of a live
CD from the currently running Arch installation.
</p>
<p>All aspects of the larch
building process connected with the installation are in this case
irrelevant, as it is assumed that the installation is already complete.
The handling of 'profiles' is also different as these are largely
concerned with the installation process. The parts of the profile which
are still relevant here are still retained, but named profiles are not
used. There is a default profile for this case (at 'share/larch/profile0')
which can be overridden by placing a customized version in the current
directory (from where <em>mklarch</em> is run).
</p>
<p>In order to support the build process, certain packages must be
installed in the system. These are:
<ul>
  <li>from the Arch repositories: cdrkit, dvd+rw-tools, squashfs-tools,
  (and aufs if you want to use that instead of unionfs).
  </li>
  <li>from the larch repository: initcpio_larch
  </li>
</ul>
It is also recommended to install archin and larchin from the larch repository
to enable use of the resulting live CD for system installation.
</p>
<p>To avoid reuse of existing base.sqf and system.sqf files, pass the '-r'
option to <strong>mklarch</strong>.
