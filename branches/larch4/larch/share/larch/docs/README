larch - scripts for building a highly customizable Arch Linux live CD
      - also suitable for installing Archlinux to a hard disk

I got my initial inspiration from the "Linux Live scripts" by

Tomas M. <http://www.linux-live.org>

BUT the larch scripts now bear essentially no resemblance to those,
so don't blame Tomas!
Thanks are, nevertheless, due to him for his great work, which helped me
get started.

The key components are:

    pacin  - Install a fresh Arch system (with customizable package
           selection), to a convenient (possibly temporary) location.

    mklarch - Uses 'pacin' to build an Arch installation in a convenient
           directory, which it then makes into a live CD, adding
	   modifications (in an overlay) to suit it for use as a live
	   system and for customization.

'pacin' is now packaged separately. There is also a small
'initcpio_larch' package, which extends the Arch 'mkinitcpio' system
to allow it to boot larch.
A hard-disk-installer, 'archin' is also packaged separately, as is
the extension, 'larchin' to allow installation of the live CD contents.
