07.01.2008:
v.4.28:
 - Fixes for file names with spaces in overlay merging.
16.12.2007:
v.4.27:
 - Updated syslinux stuff - the graphical isolinux boot now works in qemu!
v.4.26:
 - Added automatic setting of init script to rc.sysinit0 when copying
   inittab from 'system'.
v.4.25:
 - Default inittab now copied from 'system' to overlay (if none in
   overlay.xpk), removed from live_files.
11.12.2007:
v.4.24:
 - Changes to build system, to make it a little bit more transparent.
   Source package contains all PKGBUILDs in abs directory, brief build
   instructions also added there.
 - Dropped klibc-larch, now using binary 'rc.shutdown2', source at
   src/rc.shutdown2.c - linked statically to klibc.
 - Example profiles: where appropriate the xorg-video-drivers are now
   listed explicitly instead of as a group in 'addedpacks'.
 - Add larchdelay boot option: delay before switching from initramfs
   system to main boot sequence. Default is 1s, to avoid spurious
   udevd pid numbers to kill.
07.12.2007:
v.4.23:
 - Fixes to module checks in buildlive so that they also work when the
   target kernel version is different to that of the build host.
03.11.2007:
v4.21:
 - Adjustments to eliminate initcpio_larch_aufs package, in favour of
   an extended initcpio_larch package which covers ubnionfs and aufs.
   Now everything will be automatically adjusted to aufs if the module
   (i.e. the aufs package) is installed.
03.11.2007:
v4.18:
 - Added DVD without menus to gradplay.
 - Tweak for ld-linux.so in x86_64 (buildlive).
 - Removed oldmini profile.
24.10.2007:
v4.17:
 - Tweaks so that the aufs package in Arch 'extra' repository can be used,
   installing aufs-utils should be no problem (though not necessary for larch)
 - Updated rc.sysinit to match initscripts-2007.11-2
16.10.2007:
v4.16:
 - Tweaks to packages installed in gradplay profile.
   Added diffutils to addedpacks in all profiles, as it is needed by grub.
15.10.2007:
v4.15:
 - Added usb2bootiso script for making a boot iso to boot from USB-stick
   on computers which can't do that otherwise.
v4.14:
 - rc.shutdown3: fixed a silly bug concerning session save on USB-stick
 - Removed the ovlcp and ovlwr scripts as they were not really necessary
   and their use was not without problems.
v4.13:
 - gradplay profile: Put back the old /etc/mkinitcpio.conf in the
   overlay - it is needed for installation!
v4.12:
 - Fixed session-save bug in rc.shutdown, added variable bdev for
   boot device.
 - More tweaks to gradplay profile (graplay-readme is now in the cd root)
v4.11:
 - More tweaks to gradplay profile (needs specially compiled vlc
   with enabled lirc: vlc-gp)
v4.10:
 - Switch to file 'larchboot' for larch bootable recognition (was
   'system.sqf')
 - Tweaks to profile gradplay
14.10.2007:
v4.9:
 - Build system  reorganized: first svn-based release.
 - Switched profiles to aufs
03.10.2007:
v4.8:
 - boot labels for -X and -x changed
 - rc.sysinit updated
02.10.2007:
v4.7:
 - Various fixes
 - Remove kernel26 from example profile addedpacks as it is now in the
   base package set. Associated documentation changes.
v4.6:
 - Various fixes
 - Added -r option to stop reuse of sqfs with -b, -x and -X
v4.5:
 - -x and -X options also need modified inittab
v4.4:
 - buildlive fix.
 - changed iso name to larch-4
 - Documented need for mounting with exec,dev options for build option -x
 - Updated syslinux files (to version 3.52)
01.10.2007:
v4.3:
 - buildlive fix.
 - Documentation updates, including a section on the new possibilities
   for customizing session-saving.
v4.2:
 - Various fixes.
   Now INSTLDIR is specified in config_larch and LARCHBUILD is at
   "${INSTLDIR}/.larch". Also temporary stuff is now done in
   "${LARCHBUILD}/tmp".
30.09.2007:
v4.1:
 - Fixes to rc.sysinit0, mklarch and buildlive.
v4.0:
 - merge_overlay: Changed names of overlay files generated by
   merge_overlay to overlay_dddd.sqf, and fixed the counting so that
   indexes up to 9999 are possible. Also allow initial overlay files
   to have tags, e.g. overlay-xfce.sqf (the tag must begin with '-',
   '_' is not allowed in the tag, and the tag is not preserved in the
   new versions). Adjusted docs.
 - scripted extensions added...
18.09.2007:
v3.11:
 - Adjusted addedpacks in example profiles to cope with vanished 'xorg'
   package.
 - Adjusted docs concerning pacin after Arch repository changes
07.07.2007:
v3.10:
 - Added new profile 'mini2', a small, console only system with German
   keyboard, aufs instead of unionfs, LVM support and mc-utf8 (needs
   community repository).
 - A 'mkinitcpio.conf' can now (optionally) be included in the profile.
   If present it will be used instead of that supplied with the
   initcpio_larch(_aufs) package. This means that the '_ide' variants
   of initcpio_larch are no longer needed and will be removed sometime.
   If you are using them, please change your profile to use a custom
   mkinitcpio.conf. The profile 'mini2' can be taken as an example.
16.06.2007:
v3.9:
 - merge_overlay: Stripped out the buggy file difference test, and
   fixed a couple of regular expressions. Overlay recreation should
   now be more reliable, but (at least with unionfs) the overlay size
   will grow a bit.

18.05.2007:
v3.8:
 - Updated rc.sysinit and rc.shutdown to synchronize with initscripts-0.8-12
 - (added arch=("i686") to PKGBUILD for all larch packages - necessary
   for makepkg in pacman3)

08.05.2007:
v3.7:
 - Changed addedpacks in all supplied profiles to use stock kernel, as
   the beyond kernel is no longer developed.

20.04.2007:
v3.6:
 - Updated rc.sysinit to synchronize with initscripts-0.8-7, main difference
   concerns autoloading of acpi modules as of kernel26-2.20.7

v3.5:
 - Small bugfix in mklarch concerning '-x' option fixed.
 - Documentation tweaks, more info on 'baseveto'.

23.03.2007:
v3.4:
 - Discovered a nasty bug in building the initial base system (base.sqf),
   so that suid bits were not being preserved. Result: non-root users
   couldn't (u)mount anything. Hope that's fixed now.
   (Running as root you wouldn't notice it of course ...)

22.03.2007:
v3.3:
 - By using static shell and umount binaries in rc.shutdown2 I think
   I have solved the unmounting problems during shutdown. Added
   rc.shutdown3 to complete the shutdown process. These static
   binaries are taken from klibc-larch, which I have made a
   dependency of initcpio_larch(_***).
 - Found bugs in merge_overlay (session saving) which I hope I have
   fixed now (some changes were not being saved).
 - Added experimental option to use aufs instead of unionfs. This
   won't work on x64, and initially there is only a supplied module
   for the stock kernel (kernel26-2.6.20.x), so the profiles will
   need changing:

   In addedpacks put 'kernel26' instead of 'kernel26beyond' and add
   'aufs', then change 'initcpio_larch' to 'initcpio_larch_aufs' or
   'initcpio_larch_ide_aufs'

   Changed files: merge_overlay and rc.sysinit0
 - Various other very minor tweaks.

20.02.2007:
v3.2:
 - Changed all kernels in profile addedpacks to 'beyond'. The stock Arch
   kernel is at present not supported because of problems with unionfs
   and squashfs.
 - Adjusted gradplay profile to use standard vlc (not yet tested!).

28.01.2007:
v3.1:
 - Small adjustment to merge_overlay (session saving) so that /mnt is
   not copied to new overlay, only the directories it contains are
   recreated (not their contents).

31.12.2006:
v3.0:
 - New approach to using unionfs. No union mounts are set up in
   initramfs, but rather a small block of code is copied
   to memory - enough to handle setting up union mounts at boot
   and cd/dvd-writing at shutdown. The main bulk of the system is added
   in rc.sysinit0 (run before rc.sysinit), using multiple unionfs mounts.
   This should ease CD eject and session saving at shutdown
   without having to copy the whole system to memory.

25.12.2006:
v2.9:
 - added directory /mnt to save list in merge-overlay.
 - added profile 'gradplay' (ir-controlled media player).
 - added /larch/ovlcp and /larch/ovlwr for manual overlay updating
   when booting from partitioned device (usb-stick, etc.).
 - updated 'live' rc.sysinit and rc.shutdown to correspond to
   initscripts version 0.8-3.
 - added 'baseveto' file auto-detection in profiles.
 - bug fix to eject_boot_dev script.

20.11.2006:
v2.6:
 - adapted mklarch to pacin v2. N.B. There is no longer a config_pacin
 - and config_larch has been moved out of the profiles, so all profiles
   need updating! It is now in path/to/share/larch, but may be
   overridden by a config_larch in the working directory.
 - set GRUB timeout to 5s
 - restructured 'buildlive' a bit, I hope it is now clearer
 - modified 'km' (console keymap/font script) so that it also saves
   results to /etc/rc.conf so that session-saving can preserve the effect
 - added script to make GRUB-booting larch USB-stick. N.B. this is completely
   untested, and dangerous ...
 - made 'vesamenu' the default for sys-/isolinux. Profile 'oldmini' has
   previous isolinux boot stuff
 - now the interesting bits of the profile are always copied to the boot
   medium again, as profile.tar.gz, but the overlay is left out.
 - incorporated gen_loc in mklarch
 - merge_overlay now tries to detect DVDs and use growisofs. This only
   works in 'c2r' mode, but at least it should work. Added dvd+rw-tools
   to all 'addedpacks'

8.11.2006: Version 2.1
 - Tweaked grub configuration files
 - Added /larch to directories saved by merge_overlay
 - Modified session-saving to make more sense (see docs)
 - removed spurious 'save' file in 'live_files'

2.11.2006: Version 2.0
 - Fairly extensive reorganization of the package structures. There are
   now the following packages:

   On the build system you need just the first two:
     larch: mklarch and associated scripts and data
     pacin: The Arch installer script 'pacin', and associated scripts
            and data

     initcpio_larch: This is a necessary package on the live CD,
            containing scripts to extend the Arch initcpio system.

   Optional (but recommended) packages for the live CD:
     archin: An interactive (console/dialog) Archlinux installer.
     larchin: archin extensions to allow installation of larch system

   Added a script, 'larch-setup.sh', to facilitate downloading and setting
   up of 'larch' and 'pacin' to run from any location (i.e. without
   installing them).

 - The build profile is now by default not copied to the CD. Use '-e'
   option to mklarch to get it copied.

 - Various tweaks and fixes, documentation updates.

23.10.2006:
 - Added/updated some documentation.

22.10.2006:
 - Added LVM support (included in 'mini' profile).
 - Added possibility to keep (not overwrite) /etc/fstab at boot.
 - Tweaks to session saver to reduce unnecessary file saves.

10.10.2006:
 - Updated 'default' profile: tweaked addepacks (sorry, openoffice has been
  replaced by koffice to leave a bit of space), fixed icon links.
 - Fixed merge_overlay for file-names with spaces (I hope).
 - Extended docs a bit.
 - Added standard logging stuff (back) to /etc/rc.sysinit
