I have also included a few extra PKGBUILDs here, e.g. for things that I
needed for the 'gradplay' profile. The actual larch packages are:

Necessary:
larch
initcpio_larch
pacin

For archin installer:
archin
larchin

The PKGBUILDs for the larch script packages assume they are built in place
(i.e. within abs/<pkgname>). If you want to build them somewhere else, you
will need to change the '_source' variable. Note also that you will
probably need to use 'makepkg -d' for the packages listed above, to skip
the dependency checking (that is no problem, the dependencies are not
build dependencies).

To make a larch repository:
1) Build packages (remember, use 'makepkg -d' for the larch packages only).
2) Put all your packages in a directory.
3) Edit BuildScripts/repodb to point to your repository (larchrepo=your/path).
4) Run repodb.

5) Edit BuildScripts/larch-setup.sh and BuildScripts/archin-setup.sh to
point at your repository.

You can then use larch-setup.sh (and/or) archin-setup.sh to produce
ready-to-run larch/archin installations within the directory of your
choice:
Copy the script to an empty directory, then run it.
It should unpack and set up the larch packages.
From there you can then run ./mklarch ... (for example).
