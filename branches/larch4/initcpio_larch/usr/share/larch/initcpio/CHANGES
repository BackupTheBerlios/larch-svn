03.11.2007:
v4.3 - merged aufs version. For aufs, larch3 hook is named larch3_aufs
         and gen_larch_init must be called with an extra (2nd) argument,
	 '_aufs'. The appropriate mkinitcpio.conf is generated dynamically. 
14.10.2007:
v4.1 - first svn release.
     - adapted for larch-4

18.05.2007:
v3.2 - tweaked larch3 hook to deal with new initcpio 'init' script

28.12.2006:
v3.0 - changed larch hooks for new union structure:
         in initramfs base.sqf and etc.sqf are copied to memory and
	 the initial boot (/sbin/init, /etc/rc.sysinit) is done with
	 only these loaded. No unionfs mount is set up in initramfs,
	 but several unions are set up later, one for each of the main root
	 directories, at the start of rc.sysinit, where also the
	 bulk of the system is loaded; 
	 this allows unmounting of the boot device
     - switched from ide hook to pata hook (mkinitcpio.conf)
     - added ext2 to list of modules included by 'larch1' hook

12.11.2006:
v1.1 - remove kinit.shared from initcpio, thus getting rid of disturbing
       message during building
     - split larch hook into three, to allow easier implementation of
       alternative overlay file handling strategies (larch2 selects the
       overlay file)
