Check for mounted partitions

Repartitioning and formatting when partitions are mounted
can lead to big problems. Please unmount everything before
starting.

You have been warned ...

If installing from a system which itself uses disk
partitions, you must of course leave these mounted, but
be very careful not to alter these partitions in any way.
That means, with a partition editor, don't delete, resize
or move them. If you must do this, use a live CD instead.
With the installer, don't include any of these partitions
in the installation.

The following partitions are presently in use:
