Create, delete, resize partitions

Select a partition editor. If you want to move or resize a
partition you are best off using qtparted or gparted, but for
these you must be running X-windows. It is also possible from
the console, but not so simple (e.g. using  ntfsresize).

WARNING! Repartitioning is, of course, a potentially
hazardous operation. Make sure your important data is
backed up.
