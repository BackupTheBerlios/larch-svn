Generate /etc/fstab

This attempts to generate a suitable fstab file for the newly
installed system based on the selected installation partitions.
It also includes any other partitions it finds, creating
entries in /mnt for them.

The following file will be generated:

:::!dscript
mkfstab
:::!cat ${TEMPDIR}/fstab
