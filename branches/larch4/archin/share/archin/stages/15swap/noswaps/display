No swap partitions found

Unless you really have bucketfulls of memory, it is often a
good idea to have some swap space. This can be a swap file or
a swap partition (the latter probably being the normal case).
If you want a swap partition, you will have to go back to the
partition editor and create a partition of the correct type
(82).
