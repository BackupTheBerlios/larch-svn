Use pacin to install using ftp, temporary package cache

This option uses pacin's preset package selection - a fairly basic
set, without xorg.

A temporary directory on the host is used for the package cache,
which is removed after installing. It is not generally
recommended, but if you are sure you are doing a one-off
installation from a non-Archlinux or live system, and the target
has limited space, it might be worth considering.
