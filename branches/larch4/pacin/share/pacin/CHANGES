2007/10/14:
  v2.10: First svn-based release. Small cosmetic fix.
2007/10/03:
  v2.9: Mount sys and dev also for base package installation, so error
        during kernel installation doesn't occur (not that the error
	was a problem for larch - the affected image is not used anyway).
2007/09/17:
  v2.8: Updated pacin and fallback/example pacman.conf for repository
        renaming (current -> core), pacin was changed more extensively
        because of the reorganization. Now the set of base packages
        may only be obtained from packages.txt in the core repository.
	Also packages with the architecture tag should work now.
2007/07/07:
  v2.7: Updated fallback/example pacman.conf and added community repository.
        gen_repo now uses pacman's 'repo-add'.
        Small changes to pacin script: pacman downloaded from same mirror
        as package list (if needed), repo-add also extracted in this case.
2007/05/30:
  v2.6: Changed search for packages.txt source so it is not
        messed up by kdemod.
2007/05/28:
  v2.5: Adjusted pacin to accept base packages with a dot in the
        release number.
2007/04/20:
  v2.4: packages.txt is now fetched from the first server listed
        (in pacman.conf) containing '/current' in its path. This
        will in general be the same server as the packages are
        fetched from. It may also be a local ('file://') repository.
        Removed (wrong) version number from 'bin/pacin'
2007/03/31:
  v2.3: Fix to genrepo: now handles empty depends
2007/03/23:
  v2.2: Fix to genrepo. Trimmed baseveto (now empty!)
2006/12/20:
  v2.1: Trimmed baseveto.
2006/11/13:
  v2.0: Reworking of configuration options. NOT BACKWARDS COMPATIBLE.
        No config file any more, see usage message for options.
        'baseveto' data now in its own file.
        pacin now looks first in the 'working' directory for a pacman.conf
        file.
2006/11/05:
  v1.2: Changed default basepacks fetch to 'ftp'
2006/11/04:
  v1.1: Fixed silly larch-centric bug (failing when no LARCHREPO).
