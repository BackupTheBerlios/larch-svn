Copy from running larch live system

This option is exclusive to larch live media. The running
Arch system will be copied to the install point.

Files specifically modified for 'live' usage will be
taken from the underlying raw system. At present these
are:
 * /etc/rc.sysinit
 * /etc/rc.shutdown
 * /etc/inittab

Also added files (i.e. not installed by pacman) only relevant
when running in 'live' mode will not be installed.
